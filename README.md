Analysis of Fiber Gratings based on MATLAB

Spectrum analysis of three types of fiber gratings: fiber Bragg grating (FBG), chirped FBG and phase-shifted FBG. Only the base mode LP01 was considered, and apodization was introduced in the chirped FBG for comparison.

In addition, graphical user interfaces (GUI) were created for all three types of gratings. They provided friendly interfaces and made it clearer to see what the inputs and outputs are.
