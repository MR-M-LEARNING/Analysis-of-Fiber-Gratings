Analysis of Fiber Gratings based on MATLAB

Spectrum analysis of three types of fiber gratings: fiber Bragg grating (FBG), chirped FBG and phase-shifted FBG. Apodization was introduced in the chirped FBG for comparison.

In addition, graphical user interfaces (GUI) were created for all three types of gratings. They provided a friendly interface and made it clearer to see what the inputs and outputs are.
